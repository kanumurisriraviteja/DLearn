non static/ instance 

1. In a static class everything should be static 
2. In a non static class> no restriction
3. If you want to access a non static variable/method, you should do it via the object 
4. If you want to access a static variable/method you should call it via the class name
5. for the satatic variable/method you will have only one copy of memory.
6. for the non static variables/method you will have individual copies of memory.
===============================================================================================
variables : 
1. static       > only one copy of memory
2. non static   > multiple copy of memory, one for each object
3. const        > only one copy of memory, same as that of the static variable, must be initialized when ever it is defined, cannot be modified
4. readonly     > multiple copy of memory, one for each object, same as that of the non static variable,
                  after the initialized  cant be modified, but need not be initialized when it is defined, mostly assigned in the constructor

static variable can be modified, but const can't be modified
non static variables can be modified, but readonly cant be modified
===============================================================================================
constructor:

**this is first statement of execution

   1. The name should be same as that of the class name 
   2. It would not have any return type

   3. static  constructor          > It is invoked when the class name is seen for the first time  
                                   > It is called only once throgh out the program execution
                                   > static class , non static class

   4. Non static constructor       > It is invoked when the instance/object is created 
                                   > It is invoked everytime the object is created  
                                   > only in non static class

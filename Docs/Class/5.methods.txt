non static/ instance 

1. In a static class everything should be static 
2. In a non static class> no restriction
3. If you want to access a non static variable/method, you should do it via the object 
4. If you want to access a static variable/method you should call it via the class name
5. for the satatic variable you will have only one copy of memory.
6. for the non static variables you will have individual copies of memory.

constructor:

**this is first statement of execution

   1. The name should be same as that of the class name 
   2. It would not have any return type

   3. static  constructor          > It is invoked when the class name is seen for the first time  
                                   > It is called only once throgh out the program execution
                                   > static class , non static class

   4. Non static constructor       > It is invoked when the instance/object is created 
                                   > It is invoked everytime the object is created  
                                   > only in non static class

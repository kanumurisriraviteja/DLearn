Instatiation cant be done for abstract class and interface

Inheritence : 

single level Inheritence, multi level Inheritence,multiple Inheritence
In c# we dont have multiple Inheritence via classes, multiple Inheritence is possible via interfaces
The parent class constructor should not  be private or the class should not be sealed then only the Inheritence is possible.
parent cant access child properties/methods, only child can access parent
the parent of all the class is object
method overriding and method overloading, if we create a parent class reference via the child class then only the overridden methods are recognised
The scope of the parent should be more than that of the child or equal
The default scope for the memebers of an interface is public, in interface everything is abstract
interface can only have static variables, but not non static variables
interface can inherit from other interface
